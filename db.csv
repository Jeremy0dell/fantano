However, there are a slew of different factors keeping this record from sticking out in Ty's ever-growing discography: production, songwriting, vocals. All of these things keep Fuzz from feeling like a truly distinct moment--even though Ty and Charlie are shooting for an entirely different style of rock on this record. While I did like much of what Fuzz had to offer, the lack of finer details and ambition keep this LP from having much shelf life for me, honestly.  What did you think of this album? Love it? Hate it?

However, after several listens, the simplicity of this album no longer bugged me. Instead, it made this album catchy and invigorating.

Was I expecting to like this? No. Was I hoping I'd like this? Yes! A big, fat ""yes,"" actually.    I've never been an Opeth fan. Their melodic and almost overproduced take on death metal--and progressive metal, generally--just doesn't have anything I look for in music.     I was surprised by the classic progressive rock direction the band took this album in, though. The syncopated guitars, drums, and organs are a serious treat to listen to on a lotta these tracks. The acoustic interludes in these songs transition into louder moments really gracefully, too. The production ain't bad, but I'm still being held back by one major snag: the vocals.    Yes, the vocals just do nothing whatsoever for me. They just don't portray any personality to me. Opeth has always had some decent death growls, but the cleaner vocals don't hook me at all.

This straight-to-tape recording features some great guitar distortion: and the total package is so thick and saturated, it makes this album an extremely heavy and overbearing experience.    Another breath of fresh air here is the amount of variation that these guys throw into this album. Leave Home basically sees three people sharing songwriting duties, so it's not surprising to see this album coming out a little scatterbrained. Still, it's nice to hear an album that's this loud seem basically impossible to pigeonhole.    The sad part is that the Men write their tunes with some of the most forgettable and deja vu-inspiring guitar riffs imaginable. I know nothing is original these days. I'm fine with that.

From George Duke to Jaco Pastorious, some of the genre's best and brightest musicians maintain a legacy through albums like this.  Though I was a little disappointed by the overall length of some of these tracks--c'mon, two minutes--the style, musicianship, and production are all great enough to keep me coming back to this release again and again.

The group's self-titled debut contained some of my favorite singles of last year, and I was hoping the same would happen with this release.  Maybe my love of the last album lead to some unrealistic expectations, but at least some of them were met. Overall, this album feels a little more mature, and the recording is noticeably better. Plus, the band seems a little more confident in its style, sticking to a similar ""twanged-out"" sound for every track--with the exception of the synth odyssey that is ""Searching For Heaven.""  Unfortunately, this has lead to a group of tracks that just feel, well, the same. I never assumed the Drums' debut to have a ton of variation, but this album made me realize just how much it did. Together, these tracks, in my opinion, weaken one another a little bit.  What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Some fans may see it as a bit of a regression, but that's only half of the truth. The duo throws in some overdubbed guitars and bass, and manages to utilize some of the tricks they've learned working in various side-projects since the release of 2007's There's No 666 In Outer Space. There are moments on here where I actually feel could have made it onto a Zach Hill solo album.  The downside is, though I do think Hella is sounding pretty fierce on this album, the songs are filtered through a pretty weak recording. The guitars and drums sound tinny, flat, and claustrophobic. It's hardly the range of lows and highs I'd want in order to appreciate the intricate, detailed performances laced into this album.   Despite that unforgettable pothole, I like a good chunk of the tracks on here. I can't say I hated any, but I was left feeling like this was just another Hella record in some spots. However, I wouldn't want to hear anybody make a Hella record but Hella.  What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Though I wasn't in love with the whole thing, I got a nice blast of nostalgia from this LP, which reminded me of what I love most about this band: Great vocals and strong grooves. Though this album sees the band dealing with a pretty notable lineup change, they make the best of it by venturing into less familiar territory.    I'm happy that old dogs are learning new tracks on this album, but not every tick has been perfected. While an acoustic guitar intro on the third track works really well, I'm at a loss with other spots on this LP that feature bossa nova sounds, a drum machine, and some narrated vocals.

Because of that, this video takes a look at both the music and the book that comes with this package.  If anything makes the tracks on this CD stand out, it's the atmosphere. Dan Barrett has a somewhat messy production style, but like any Mount Eerie album, it lends this project an interesting sound you're not gonna hear anywhere else.  With one track after another being slathered in reverb, there are moments on here that remind me of Grizzly Bear's 2007 album Yellow House. However, there's a disturbing aura surrounding this album, which the book empowers.  Though there are some standout songs on this release, I like to take it as more of an experience--not just an assembly of tracks. Because to me, this album stirs up the same emotions any great piece of horror or science fiction would. Those emotions are filtered through a singer-songwriter lens, and it somehow works.

They're not really the angry, voluminous extremes the latest Death Grips album functions on. They're more like extremes of excess. Of course, what Danny is being excessive with is drugs, sex, misogyny, and basically anything else that one can have too much of.  Though it's nothing new to hear someone rapping about this stuff, Danny takes it from a darker angle. The drugs and sex on this album don't really feel all that flashy or commendable. Instead, it's shocking enough to make a listener wanna go Mormon.  The flows are hard, the beats are pretty experimental, and I'm totally down with this guy's outlandish lyricism. Loving it.

When the album originally came out in May, I took some favorites from it, but dismissed the rest as being too hectic to be really enjoyable.  However, I found myself just itching to listen to this thing again at the beginning of this month. To my surprise, I ended up loving the album from front to back.

The production, for me, is a real blessing on this LP. The sounds are so pretty, which actually makes me wanna revisit a great deal of these tracks.  But as far as songwriting and vocal deliveries go, the nail isn't hit on the head every single time. Plus, a good chunk of these songs either feel too alike other tracks on this album.

But what makes the dreary, depressing feelings on this album so palatable is that Wolfe attacks this darkness from multiple angles with noise rock guitars, doom metal riffs, ambient soundscapes, smooth beats, and blood-curdling snarls.

It's just my opinion, but I didn't find much to get enraged over in the lyrics on this album. Being told where to pee should be the least of society's worries.  There are bellyaches aimed toward cops and authority on this album, but the fish these songs do fry are small ones. There's nothing that boldly points at things like corruption or even police brutality. The lyrics just cry out against the same restrictions a parent might put on a toddler. If Cerebral Ballzy had a rap sheet, I'd guess it would be filled mostly with counts of loitering, vandalism, and petty theft.   Aside from the thrashy riffs and great production, I guess I don't see a lot of purpose in this record.

The heavyweight MCs celebrate their relevancy, fame, and popularity with one track after another--occasionally stopping to make an introspective or societal observation. While the idea of the album is great, not every song is as fantastic as the next.   No matter which songs seem appealing on this album, there are bound to be some that pale in comparison since this album is a little scatterbrained when it comes to beat and lyrical quality.   Kanye and Jay-Z take this thing in numerous directions, relying on their celebrity status to carry the album forward. Kanye and Jay-Z relying on their star power isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I've loved a lot of music these guys have put out in the past, but my love stops there.

I was sure all this waiting would result in something bigger and better, but the ambition needed for that doesn't surface on the Rip Tide. It just seems like business as usual.

It was a time when Phonodisk, a record label looking to engineer hits, started promoting Nigerian bands playing with some sounds that were big in the West at the time: disco and funk.  Some of the tracks here are produced so well, and are a perfect recreation the formula that produced so many chart-topping hits. Others have the basic elements, but are hilariously off the mark. Honesty, I don't know who told some of these people they could sing. I'm looking at you Amel Addmore.  Though there are some sideshows and missteps, a majority of the tracks on here are pretty solid. Sometimes the foreign charm even helps the track out, which is the case for tracks like ""Big Race,"" ""Boys and Girls,"" and ""Music Alone.""  It's a fun compilation.

There are moments tracks influenced by the world of wonky hip hop instrumentals--you know, the kinda stuff Brainfeeder drops on a regular basis--which is something this guys has always had a soft spot for.    But Machinedrum is very good about appealing to the winds of change whenever possible. And now that the sounds of dubstep and future garage are hot, he's trying his hand at recreating the sounds have have made names for guys like Burial.

And with numerous bands looking for new ways to modernize and gussy up death metal, I couldn't be more depressed. Thankfully, Disma keeps things ugly and repulsive on Towards the Megalith.  Featuring vocalist Craig PIllard of Incantation, growls on this LP are frigging blood-curdling. The vocals have a panoramic presence that doesn't occur on most death metal LPs--and I'm talking about new and old school. The music amplifies that effect, too, with lots of heavy, distorted basslines and crackling guitar riffs.  It's a mighty death metal album that relives the old days in a big, mountainous way.

With Hodgy Beats on the mic and Left Brain building the beats, the tracks here offer up a series of fantasy raps about girls, weed, and guns. This is by no means an mind-blower of an album, but that's definitely made up for in simplicity and accessibility.  The beats here are a slight cut above what usually makes it onto an Odd Future-related album, and Hodgy Beats' mic skills are good, too.  Still, don't come in here expecting a mature personality ready to spit something highbrow. This album is much more primal. And part of what makes it a more refreshing release than Goblin is that it's not weighted down in internet drama and blog post bullshit.   There are some undeniably good hip hop tracks on here. but do yourself a favor and try not to take this album too seriously. I highly doubt Hodgy Beats and Mike G play corners, and I don't think anybody in the Odd Future crew is a cop killer. As immature as this album can be, it's all for fun. Don't you remember being younger and wanting to say whatever you wanted? That's what attracted me to Bastard so much. This album walks along those lines, too, but with noticeably less consistency.

Making things simpler to gain a wider audience just seems like something a band in Little Dragons' shoes would do, though. They've had plenty of opportunities to collaborate with some pretty high-profile artists in the past year or so: Big Boi, SBTRKT, the Gorillaz.  Rather than turning up the volume, Ritual Union brings things down to a low and sensual simmer. Every track here is backed up with simple, repetitive grooves that grow as the song progresses. The synths aren't as loud or bright as they were in '09, but they still sound fantastic.  Of course, this is all topped off with frontwoman Yukumi's fantastic voice. She really lays it all out on this album, lending the music tons of personality and emotion.  It's less instant than these guys have been in the past, but revisiting this album to see it unfold was very worth it for me. This album doesn't put out, it pulls in.

This record isn't completely devoid of fun or flavor. The Johns' usual buffet of strong melodies, catchy hooks, and esoteric lyrics is here. If anything on this album will keep longtime fans happy, it's that.  However, the sound here is really lacking the bold and kooky flavor I'm usually in line to be served. It sounds like something that would get plainly cited as a more mature direction. To me, it's just less. Less fun, less color, less spirit.  I wasn't offended by this album, and there's a good chunk of songs on here that are so good they make the sound of Join Us irrelevant. Still, not every track scratched that itch.

The Man made its Atlantic Records debut with this new album, In the Mountain In the Cloud. And because I didn't really like the band's past two albums, I'm surprised to see the music moving in a direction I like a lot more this time around.  The ambition that permeated from Portugal's earlier work is more present here. Though the band still feels it necessary to edit their songs heavily, structuring them down to the most simple of parts, the instrumentation is too big, bright, and joyous to not enjoy. Plus, the band does let go a bit on some of the songs here, allowing the music to wander indulgently and build tension.  It's not amazing me, but I'll take it.  What do you think of this album?

Rather than sticking to their guns, the band is moving in a decidedly psychedelic and atmospheric direction with many tracks on Skying. And while their aren't any terrible tracks to be heard on this release, some of the results are underwhelming, admittedly.

Ulcerate- The Destroyers of All ALBUM REVIEW,Wp20Qxx2lOc,2011-07-06T10:23:38.000Z,31684,386,27,310,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohM8JU-VcX0  Ulcerate's latest album might not hit the spot for fans of the New Zealand group's more hectic material, but it definitely resonated with me. The relentless drumming and dissonant guitar passages create an ugly atmosphere that's ever-evolving. These guys display an extreme level of technical precision on each of these seven tracks, but the music isn't so flashy that it loses me. In fact, that precision manifests itself into a ton of interplay and some sick grooves that are almost too dizzying to follow.  It's a solid metal album. I may not be completely down with how it was mixed, but the performances are absolutely stellar. Definitely a heavy treat.  What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Like always, the band's frontman, David, brings these songs to live with his approachable voice and personality.     To me, some songs really do pale in comparison to others, but albums with this kind of personality have always tended to wear thin with me a little bit.

It's definitely an indulgent LP that requires a little bit of effort from the listener, but repeating these songs until they completely unfold is worth the wait.  Part of me is sure this album is going to warrant a lot of comments like, "" I don't usually listen to hip hop, but this is great!"" But that shouldn't discourage people who listen to the genre more regularly to check it out. Though this album sounds like it came outta nowhere, the artists on it haven't. Lazaro's experience goes way back to the 90s hip hop outfit Digable Planets, but exactly which planet he's on with this album is a hard question to answer.  if you're a fan of the mutant expressions from artists such as Zeroh, Quasimoto, or Madvillain, check it out.

Cults- Cults ALBUM REVIEW,dFa1CV4IzhM,2011-06-26T09:46:46.000Z,23636,233,61,302,"Listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPKbG1CCLx8  New York's Cults have a deeply rooted love for pop's older and more sentimental side. Considering how referential this music is, these two must be extremely well-verse when it comes to the Spectors, Wilsons, and Meeks of the world. I'm sure they're even fans of artists in the Twee genre some people are so willing to label them with.  The duo's style and sunny disposition is definitely the most solid thing this album has going for it--well, that's the case for some people, anyway.  For me, it's these very things that are kind of pushing me away from this album. Sure, I dig on Camera Obscura or some Pains of Being Pure at Heart, but this is too sweet for even me.   A few of the songs here, like ""Go Outside"" and ""Oh My God,"" come off with original melodies and fleshed out song structures, but many tracks here feel too familiar for me to want to latch on. Some songs even lazily fade out after a quick couple of verses and choruses, like ""Abducted,"" leaving me wanting a lot more.  So, I'm pretty lost on this one. It's definitely sweet, but I can't say much more about it than that. Just some young and fun revivalism that flies in one ear, and quickly shoots out the other for me.

I apologize for the confusion. I edited the video's audio to fix the mistake.  On SBTRKT's self-titled debut, this London-based producer cooks up a solid set of dubstep songs; icing them with some pretty soulful vocals from Sampha. Plus, the clean and lean electronics bubbling under him are the perfect complement to the feelings he's conveying. There are several different vocalists featured, though, and not all of them are as much of a treat to hear--with the exception of Little Dragon, of course.  I'd recommend this highly to both Flying Lotus and James Blake fans, because there's so much worth comparing between these three artists. Not only is Sampha's voice pretty close to Blake's, but the lush layers of synthetic tones on a lot of these songs remind me of more recent tracks in Fly Lo's discography.  This is a solid debut for me. Great beats, vocals I get caught up in, and catchy hooks.  What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Bon Iver- Bon Iver ALBUM REVIEW,j_LB2pqybaM,2011-06-21T09:00:18.000Z,172936,1278,960,803,"Listen: http://theneedledrop.com/2011/06/stream-the-new-bon-iver/  On Bon Iver's Bon Iver, the project opens the floodgates and welcomes in a sea of new instrumentation. Everything from clarinet to string arrangements are laced into these songs to widen the spectrum of sounds that were once so sparse four years ago on For Emma, Forever Ago.  But just because we've got a ton of new sounds doesn't mean they've been arranged or mixed all that well.  It might be impressive to see some of these songs played life--well, it might be very impressive, actually. But the thing is the recording quality of this LP squishes so many of the climaxes here until they're a strip of roadkill on the summer asphalt. When that's not the issues, saxophones or guitars may wander around the mix aimlessly, looking for some kind of pocket to fit in.   It's a little like watching a grade school soccer game. No one player paying attention to his or her position or duty on the field. Instead, everybody is just running for the ball at once.  Don't get me wrong, because I do think a lot of the songs on here are pretty strong. I'd probably love all of these tracks if they were recorded with as much modesty and focus as ""Wash."" or ""Towers.""

These guys put their drama and hip hop superstar backgrounds behind them to send out verse after rap battle verse that paint them as two of the most uncaring, reckless, and misogynistic men on the planet. Or rather, Evil.  While the lyrics are vivid and the flows are unstoppable--especially on the posse track that ends this EP--there's nothing all that special or unique about these beats or hooks. The fact of the matter is the production isn't living up to how great of a tag team these two Detroit vets are.  Still, despite what issues this album has, this is a must-listen for both Royce and Em fans. Because they really do push one another to write some great verses on this one. Hopefully, we won't need to wait another decade for these guys to release another set of tracks.  What do you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

It's pretty, well, complicated.  As ""epic"" as this story is, what makes it grandiose also kinda kills it for me, too. These songs make use of punk's trademark aggression and speed, but draws all the intensity out to a point where it no longer feels energetic, thrilling, cathartic, or any of the other things I look to this style of music for.  Which leads me to believe that it's just not for me. Maybe some of the more melodic moments could have gone over better if the vocals displayed as much dynamics, but the recording, instrumentation, and message are all pretty good.

The recording of this this is really great, too. It separates the instrumentation perfectly, and swells very nicely when everything layers on top of one another.  The melodies are decent, and the grooves are nice, but some of these tracks come off a little flat in the interplay department. At times, it can feel like the drums and everything else are in two completely different worlds. While the skins do their best to throw in fills and build up to certain moments, the guitars and keys tend to carry on like they're the only thing that matters in the mix, which only leads to them missing out on possible moments of syncopation.   There are a couple tracks that strike me as filler, but Snake Oil still pulled together a solid direction on their self-titled debut, and they're off to a great start with these 9 tracks.

The guys play with sunshine pop, garage rock, and even some Queens of the Stone Age-esque riffage make it into the mix.  But the problem is, the band's spin on these old school sounds isn't that interesting. For a fan, it may be interesting to see the group do something different, but as someone who isn't a diehard for this group, hearing the 'Monkeys do this isn't any more thrilling than hearing any other group do it.  There are a few tracks here that standout from a songwriting standpoint, but much of this record is about hearing the band play with a bunch of sounds they love, not develop something with a distinct style or personality.

But some of the songs here just feel too unfinished to really feel memorable or exciting for me. I dig this band a lot, but I almost feel like I've fallen off the wagon on this one.  Their past several records, in my opinion, have been fantastic. This feels like it lives in the shadow of Woods' previous material because of its underwhelming execution, half-baked songs, and melodies that are eerily similar to that of past material from this band.  Plus, what's possibly the most enjoyable track here is a cover song.  I'm not on board with this album, sadly, but these guys seem to drop something new about every year. Maybe I'll like the next release more.   What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Honestly, not much. Not only that, but I'm awestruck at how positive some of the receptions have been to what she's doing. I don't begrudge her the fanbase she's gathered so far--especially since her first album was pretty good--but hearing the majority opinion differ so much from what I feel personally makes me question my own sanity, honestly.  But on her latest album, Planningtorock makes about every move possible to use terrible vocal effects, construct flat and repetitive songs, and flaunt weak melodies like they're something to behold.  The lyrics are pretty lacking as well. I'm still not sure what significance being on fire holds for this album, but it sure seems like a central theme on some of these songs. The problem is most of the time I feel like Planningtorock is just writing lyrics to have them, or to have something to sing in her vocal parts.  Between the effects, songwriting, singing, and lyrics, I couldn't find one moment I loved about this album. There are spots that are relatively better than others, but I was bored or offended on most of these tracks.  What makes it worse is there's a stench that surrounds this album that smells a lot like the Knife for Fever ray. Honestly, I've got not problems with showing off your influences, but at least do them justice.  I've said in prior reviews, you're probably not making interesting art if you're not offending somebody. Maybe this is objectively ""good"" music, and I just happen to be that one guy it offends.

I guess I used to be one of them, too.  But because of all the requests and my own curiosity, I figured I'd try out Codes and Keys since it's been a while since I tried to get into this band's recent output.  While I wasn't blown away, I was pleasantly surprised to see Gibbard and the gang still ""have it."" Their songwriting is leaner and catchier than ever. Maybe the songs aren't as emotionally torn as the band's early work, but I have to admit I was enjoying the positive vibes that this album was giving off. There are so many feel-good moments on here between ""You are a Tourist"" and ""Underneath the Sycamore.""  While many groups have taken the ""indie"" sound and tried growing it into something flashier, Death Cab is keeping things earnest and honest. If you're looking for some down-to-earth pop music, there's no reason not to visit with this album.  Sure, Death Cab is far past the point in their career where they're mostly break new ground or something like that. But this isn't exactly what this album is shooting for anyway. This LP appeals to a part of me that positively reviewed that Cake record earlier this year, too. Sometimes, it's nice to take it easy, lay back, and just enjoy something doesn't doesn't require reading into the lyrics or pulling apart every minor subtlety.

Not only are some strong new wave influences tastefully shown on off this thing, but the songwriting is crafted for maximum enjoyability.  With strong melodies, beats, and guest singers, Theo has set a serious bar for himself when his next full-length drops later this year. Outperforming singles like ""Flying Overseas"" is going to be a tough thing to do.  Overall, these songs are rich with hooks, melody, and personality.

First, I was happy to hear how alive and ambitious the first half of this album was. Not only are the hooks and instrumentation strong, but the band seems equally comfortable saying something beautiful or funny with their lyrics.  But the second shocker was when the latter half of this record pulled the rug out from under me with some pretty underwhelming songwriting and vocal deliveries. While it's nice to have some familiar reference points on this album--which show up in some tried and true chord progressions and melodies--My Morning Jacket doesn't exactly refurbish these ideas in a very exciting way.

That's fine, though. Most of the time--no matter what style these seven guys happen to be embracing--they always put a ton of heart and creativity into what they're doing.   Some tracks on this third installment in the Totem series create dark soundscapes, and others feel like seeing a rebel group of desert guitarists play the kind of heavy psych rock bands like Tinariwen are known for popularizing.

Hearing the band revisit old sounds, work with an odd drum mix, and working with similar structures throughout this album make me rethink my original love for some of the tracks here. In terms of structure, I'm really not wowed by this album.  Where I am incredibly impressed is with the textures here! The sounds are fantastic, and some of the best I've heard this year. They're kind of a saving grace for this album. The guitars sound amazing, and the swells here are so subtle. Sure, this could be labeled as ""post-rock"" at some points, but This Will Destroy You are working with tools that just seem out of this world as several points on this album.

The band's loose song structures and loose playing bring a lot of, well, ""character"" to these recordings. There are flubbed notes everywhere, and it's all for the sake of sounding noisier.  Chaos within limits is the name of the game on Homo, and I'll be dammed if these guys didn't make sounding messy feel fun as hell!  There's an obvious Velvet Underground influence flowing throughout this. A lot of these tracks feel like abridged versions of the song ""Sister Ray,"" but there's also a lot of love if you're more of a fan of the Fall or the Stooges.

The textures on most of this album are absolutely amazing, and among the best this Brazilian electronica producer has ever created.    I love how abstract, adventurous, and mind-bending the first two thirds of this album can be, but the mood takes an odd turn toward the finish line.    Tracks like ""Kitty Cat"" and ""Bedroom Stories"" represent a lighter, cuter side to this release that doesn't necessarily agree with me. Not only did I not see the album going in this direction, but it's not necessarily a place I wanted to go.    There is a creepy, eerie momentum to the last third of this LP, but it definitely doesn't measure up to my love of the massive sounds located at the start of ISAM.    Still, the last portion of this album isn't terrible. Maybe it just seems out of place. Tobin does make efforts to guide one section of this album into the other with some lighter interludes in the middle of this LP, but the final songs here are still kinda lost on me.

They've exchanged this for some relatively heavier production and string arrangements. In my opinion, it wasn't that great of a trade.  Though all of these arrangements lend Simple Math a finer, more dynamic feel, many of the songs here feel drowned out in their wish to cloak themselves in different sounds. Sometimes that sound is a booming guitar, and sometimes it's a horn.  It's nice to hear these guys incorporating more textures into their repertoire on this LP, but it's at the sacrifice of some decent indie rock songwriting. ""Deer"" and ""Pensacola"" come off as two of the most earnest songs here. Much of what I'm listening to here feels too overblown for me to really enjoy thoroughly.  But, that's just my opinion.

Another great addition to this band's style is their use of swells and crescendos, and it's not in the cliche post-rock way that we're all so used to. This band's dynamics are a result of musicianship and performing as a cohesive unit, not a ton of sound effects throw in during post-production.  Outside of that, the chord progressions of this album are rich and melodic. It's a sweet counterpoint to all of the harsh vocals, guitar chords, and crash cymbals. The moments where tremolo-picked guitars are layered on top of each other only enhance the effect.  There are a few underwhelming moments, and a couple detours, but the album is pretty dang solid!

Some of these might be the best this comedy rap outfit has ever penned. ""I Just Had Sex"" has already blown most of their other videos away on the view count, and the title track is a hilarious piece of wardrobe humor I've never really heard them dive into before.  The features here are pretty nice. I heard everybody from Beck to MIchael Bolton on here. I guess my only problem is some of these tracks aren't that funny to me at all. Some even fail to reach a level of ridiculousness some of the other tracks do. I'd figure with a song like ""I Just Had Sex"" on there, songs like ""The Creep"" would have some kind of bar to reach for when it came to jokes and gags.   Plus, it sort of bugs me that this music sounds exactly like the style of pop rap it's trying to create a slight parody of. I guess you should keep your enemies close, but we're so close it's hard to tell what the relationship Lonely Island has with this music really is. Maybe they're ""frenemies""?  Either way, tracks like ""Jack Sparrow"" and ""Throw It On the Ground"" are refreshingly absurd, letting go of any perceived need to make sense. That, to me, is where I really get something out of this album. The dick jokes are alright, too.  What do you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? What do you think of comedy in music? What is the funniest song you've ever heard? Is it ""Pizza Party"" by L'Homme Run? Is it ""Like  Surgeon by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic?  5 8====Ds out of 10 8=======Ds  http://theneedledrop.com http://bit.ly/tndsupport http://bit.ly/TNDTwitter http://bit.ly/TNDFacebook http://bit.ly/TNDPodcast http://theneedledrop.com/forum  FAV TRACKS: I JUST HAD SEX (FEAT.

Though this LP still holds some of the grooves their last albums did, the songs here carry a much more serious tone--maybe too serious?    There are some great tunes and passionate vocals here, but a good chunk of these tracks come off as being merely agreeable--you know, not offending or enthralling.    I'll be listening for this band's next release, because I am intrigued by what their next move will be, but I'm still stopping just short of loving this LP.    What do you think of this LP? Love it?

The instruments and the mix sound absolutely fantastic.  But there are more changes. First off, the storytelling that made their past LP so seductive to many has kind of left the building this time. There are tales told in these songs, but this unorganized collection of ten tracks feels like exactly that.  Still, there are a couple flickers of great songwriting here, and the new direction these guys are going in have made things much more accessible. However, there's this nondescript feeling I can't shake from this album. So much of it feels underwhelming or forgettable to me. The oddest moments are those that sound like they could have come out of a Radiohead tune--which only reminds me how flat the drama really is here.  But that's just me.

Keep in mind the key word here is ""improve,"" not change. Yes, the band is still walking down the same path they were on their previous LP, but they're much further down the road, and they've got a different story to tell.  The songs on this album are extremely romantic, and not just in the sense that two lovers are romantic with one another. This album is unbelievably in love with everything around it. It finds great beauty in the world at large, and it's led to captivating melodies and poetic lyrics that tip a hat to songwriting greats like Paul Simon.  The instrumentation could come off kind of busy and overbearing for a first-time listener, but the water's feels fine after the initial shock. This thing is beautifully produced from my point of view. More detail gets pulled out of of this thing with each listen--lyrically and sonically.

New Ganglians track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4439  On their latest album, Explosions In the Sky gives the appearance of evolution with some added instrumentation: acoustic guitar, strings, hums, looped percussion, and other miscellaneous noises. However, the band hasn't really altered their playing style or sonic qualities that much. The mood has changed a little, but this is still the same band that brought All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone.  For some, that could be a great thing. Personally, it's left me really underwhelmed. Not only did I assume--a bad thing on my part, I admit--there would be some great change coming in the four years between this release and their last, but I'm not really a fan of many of the new sounds this record brings to the table. I'm enjoying some spots in the gargantuan post-rock anthems, but I'm struggling with hear an entire track without becoming bored or disengaged.

There's a kinetic energy between the three of them that's difficult to explain. I know these guys aren't for everybody, but there's something about their collective enthusiasm that's charmed me into loving their music.   The rhymes here aren't anything out of the ordinary for the band. This LP is loaded with jokes, obscure references, non-sequiturs, and cunning wordplay. It doesn't have the storytelling I usually love in my hip hop, but this LP is more about living in the moment than it is chewing things over.  But the absolute cherry on top of this album is the production. It's thick, heavy, textured, noisy, psychedelic, and fantastic. It's absolutely exciting to hear the Beasties advancing their sound this late in their career. It's like they took the electronic hip hop fusions on Hello Nasty and turned them into an unstoppable monster, which is now destroying the city.

All of the atmospheric textures make the perfect setting for lyrical themes dealing with dreams.   Of course, ""dreaming"" isn't limited to what you see in your sleep. This LP delves into fantasies of all shapes and sizes: sexual, violent, ambitious.   As interesting as it is to see Cunnin' take on this topic, I do have to admit that this type of rap music is not for the cynical.

It serves mostly as a stage for his poetic musings about Drovers, a self-sunk boat, a marriage gone sour, and American values.

I'm not trying to say this thing forges new ground or reinvents certain sounds or styles. Not the case. In fact, this album pulls a little bit too much from African music and the Dirty Projectors to be a piece of originality.    This album's bold attitude comes from the fact it just doesn't care what you think.

Their dedication to thrash metal riffs and a natural-sounding production style calls back to the genre's salad days in the 80s.  But not everything here is from the past. The band's intensity and speedy drums and guitar definitely feel 2011.  To me, this album is a reminder that musical movements can miss great things if everyone is in a rush to follow a trend or new extreme.

I know the in-the-moment sound bands like Terrorizer and Napalm Death had is a thing of the past, but even Pig Destroyer is a lot less scheduled than this band.   The high-gloss finish on this production and the impressive musicianship will make this album entertaining for a lot of people, which is fine.

My Morning Jacket track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4150 2. Indian track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=4104  Wasting Light is easily one of Foo Fighters' most consistent effort in their past several albums, but it's not resonating with me like I wanted it to. Chalk it up to the album just not being my style, I suppose.  Still, I can appreciate a great studio sound when I hear one. The guitars here are thick and gratifying in a way that reminds me of some great Queens of the Stone Age tunes. Some of the harder tracks here--like ""White Limo"" remind me of moments from the Foos' first album!  Still, there's a bit of an arena rock flavor on this LP that seems a little out of character. It's not bad, but not exactly a return to form either. I'd be alright with it if it weren't for the relentlessly generic lyricism. I understand the topics music touches on can be a little cliche, but layering that with phrases like ""you and what army"" and ""it's alright"" only make things worse--not to mention it subtracts some authenticity points.  Overall, it's not a bad album. I enjoyed it while it was on, but don't expect to find gold if you're digging for a deeper meaning here. Only a few tracks are good for that.

The tunes here are much more upbeat, and there are a few legit hits that sneak their way into the track list like ""Shake the Shackles"" and ""Through the Floor.""  In addition to that, piano and organ show up a lot more, too. They actually grab more attention than the guitar a many of these tracks, creating a lazily smashed back beat that reminds me of the Velvet Underground's ""Sister Ray""--which isn't a bad tune to share similarities with, honestly.  The lyrics bring up a lot of surrealist imagery, and the invasive reverb only intensifies the dreamy soundscape.  Though Crystal Stilts wear their influences pretty proudly, there's something about them that keeps me from listening to the influences instead. There's spooky and ominous delivery to their music that just hypnotizes me into pressing the play button again and again.   What do you think of this album? Do you be lovin' it? Do you be hatin' it?

Imagine this album as an indie film, and you've been given a free ticket. Considering the fact you paid no money, the picture quality, sets, costumes, and camerawork are all quite good. Loos pretty hi-production! Maybe it'll be promising.   But then the lead actor walks into frame, and it becomes painfully clear things are going downhill. His mannerisms are awkward, his phrasing is generic, and he wasn't given the best of lines.   He's kind of like a younger, more risk-taking version of Johnny in Tommy Wiseau's the Room. He's nobody to sympathize with. His emotions are legitimate--even if they are a little overly dramatic--but he lacks the ability to express himself in a remotely captivating way.

Natural Child MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3815  On their latest LP bring a lotta tunes with little cohesion. There's a kinda shaky love song theme linking some of these tracks together, but it doesn't stop tracks like ""No Future Shock"" from jumping in out of nowhere.   I enjoy quite a few of the tracks here, but for very separate reasons. ""Killer Crane"" has a fantastically blissful aura surrounding it; ""Caffeinated Consciousness"" is an in-your-face piece of funk rock that makes no apologies; and ""Second Song"" captures an emotional overload perfectly in the lyrics.  Though the instrumentation, production, words all have their strong points, there are only several moments where they all align as one to create something fantastic and memorable. ""Will Do"" is a shining example.   A lot of these tracks are great as on a single basis, but don't really impress me that much as a procession of tracks.   What do you think of this album?

French Horn Rebellion MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3749 2. Seekae MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3744  Timber Timbre's latest album is a scarily obsessive look at one man's post-relationship trauma. The infatuation in the lyrics here runs deep, and it's tempting to hear the record from beginning to end just to see how bad the train wreck gets.  Not that lyrics and some mild psychosis are all this album has going for it. There are plenty of fantastic arrangements, which were created with the aid of Mathieu Charbonneau. Colin Stetson lays some great horn parts down, and Mark Lawson helped take the Timber's production up another level.  The music--outside of the instrumentals--lives in a world were doo wop and rockabilly reign supreme. And it puts an innocent backdrop behind the insane musings of this character painted in the words.  It's a shadowy standout in the world of lovesick albums.  What do you think of this album? Love it?

What Did You Expect From the Vaccines? is a record that functions on those basic principles of a catchy rock album: energy, straightforwardness, volume.    With influences ranging from the Ramones to the Jesus & Mary Chain, there's definitely some ear-shattering guitar reverb on a few of these tracks, but the Vaccines rely on simplicity more than they do guts. A few tracks do stand out a being exceptionally rowdy, but there are plenty of moments where this album lowers the heat to a simmer. To me, the slower moments aren't as captivating as the fast, but it's nice the band added more than one dimension to the songs here.    While I don't think originality is the most important of things--especially since everything is influenced by something--I find it difficult finding something to take away from this album. There a handful of fun tracks; and while the others aren't bad at all, they're nothing to flip out over, for me.    I enjoyed it, but I'm in no rush to come back, that's all. Just my opinion.

Snake Oil Vid: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3637  Holy Ghost!'s debut LP is buff with great sounds, songs, and production value. This is not some soggy, lo-fi set of dance tracks you'd find for free on the internet somewhere. This is a crisp, lush barrage of beats and hooks.  This LP is on DFA Records, and Holy Ghost! is currently holding the torch when it comes to the label's reputation for great alternative dance music.  A lotta the hooks and melodies here stuck with me instantly, but the game this band plays has been played before--but arguably, no one is yet to play it this well in 2011.   While I've heard this style before, it hasn't stopped me from enjoying this at all. If there's a great song behind the aesthetic, there's no reason to get hung up.  What do you think of this LP?

I have to admit I kind of saw this coming, though. Many of these tracks were released on singles before the album release, and I only enjoyed a few of them. However, I have to admit that the sonice qualities of these tracks really do come together into a cohesive direction on the LP. Everything works together as one. The album is basically Voltron, and the singles were merely automatons waiting to be assembled into a psych pop war machine.  Though the direction and style this album embraces is pretty clear, I can't say I'm a fan of it. The disruptive, glossy delay that's covering nearly everything on these songs doesn't make them all that appealing. For me, it actually has the opposite effect. Panda Bear writes some really captivating melodies on ""Surfer's Hymn"" and ""Last Night at the Jetty,"" but the cut and paste percussion, cacophonous mixing, and muddy guitar sounds hardly serve as the perfect foundation to make these songs shine. The atmosphere on Person Pitch was so much less disruptive, which really let the songs shine. This album obviously puts a stronger emphasis on effects and volume, but neither are doing much for me.   The hazy wall of sound Panda Bear builds again and again on these tracks does put me into a mesmirized state of mind a few times--namely ""Afterburner"" and ""Alsation Darn."" But for me, the high is pretty mild.  I give Panda Bear a lot of respect for doing what he does in Animal Collective and in a solo capacity. I'll always check out whatever new joint he's pushing. This one just didn't do a lot for me, that's all. Respect.  What do you think of this LP? Is it lackluster? Is it amazing? Why?

Blake Mills Review: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3441  2. Fleet Foxes Vid: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=3422    Trap Them's third album won't be a shock if you've heard their earlier work, but they have inched once more toward a unified sound.     With Kurt Ballou at the controls again, the band has built a torturous gauntlet of twelve pounding tracks. They've got the intensity of Converge, plenty of d-beat rhythms, and a buzzsaw guitar tone that recalls early Entombed.     The band really does have a lot going for them. They might drown in their influences a bit, but they're carving a pretty nice niche for themselves in a pretty established sound. The stronger songwriting this time around is partially to blame. Not only has this band gotten a bit louder, but they're a lot more memorable, too. Though I wasn't in love with the whole album, ""the Facts"" will still be stuck in my head come December.

Not that this album isn't tuneful. In many respects it is. ""Light Sleep"" and ""Take Off Your Shirt"" are two examples. My issue is that the songs don't stand out that much to me. Bibio's abilities as a sonic chameleon are really what steal the show. But will only keep me entertained for so many listens.

This slight change in direction didn't sit well with me on first listen, though. I was a little disappointed to see the noisier, more experimental elements of their music sort of melt away here; however, the band is definitely moving in a definitive direction.  This is the sound of the Pains coming into their own. Just like Beach House did with their latest album, the band is building on their initial sound with some panoramic production and more accessible sounds.  The songwriting is still strong and catchy.

So they use every track to obtain a different sound. Moments like ""Under Cover of Darkness"" embrace what's best about the band's past work, but ""Two Kinds of Happiness"" shoots for a sound most would probably associate with the 80s.

The beats attempt to copy the trademark RZA sound, the rhymes are decent at best, and the features are simply alright, too.    It's pretty obvious that this release makes little to no attempt to push itself past anything Raekwon did on his previous album, which is sad since Cuban Linx II was a pretty ambitious release.     I'm sure Raekwon hasn't lost his footing or his ear for a good track. This thing seems like a mere transition between Cuban Linx II and Rae's next big project.

Not to say that he's crazy, but his music is a little all over the place.  This is because Siriusmo has absolutely no interest in appealing to one particular type of electronic music fan. This album is littered with club bangers, dubstep bass, odd samples, and subtle flourishes of syths.   Though Siriusmo proves he's comfortable just about everywhere, not every song feels as finished as the next. Some cut and run before they really get to leave an impression, sadly.

My Brightest Diamond and Laurie Anderson even show up for vocal duty on a good chunk of this album, too; bringing a new depth to the experimental nature of this album.  I guess I have to warn y'all, though. This album is music that's meant to be observed. It's nothing to party to, that's for sure.

It's loaded with beautiful and well-recorded sounds, and even Thom Yorke's songwriting shows some muscle with moments like ""Lotus Flower"" and ""Separator.""   But there's something that clicks away and eats away at the first half of this album, in my opinion. Though I like what I'm hearing, I can't say I'm enjoying how it's organized. It kinda sounds like the beat arrangements were produced on a ""ctrl + c / ctrl + v"" basis.   The second half of this album is a bit of a different story, though. ""Give Up the Ghost"" and ""Codex"" are a really nice break from the beats, but I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed by what's going on here.

The most noticeable change this time around is some longer song lengths and a lot of bowed instrumentation. Of course, I'm a fan of the cello, but the production here doesn't exactly find a flattering place for it in the mix.

Heidecker & Wood MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2594    The Decemberists' latest album, the King Is Dead, feels like a toned down version of the band's roots, for me. For some, it may be a welcome departure from the band's eccentric vocals and indulgent stories, but that's what made them interesting to me in the first place. Seeing these elements leave the stage makes this album very underwhelming for me. It's ultra-crisp production and mundane instrumentation only worsen my problems.    Colin still has a great presence, and the songwriting is still quite good; however, what these songs are shelled in is making me shy away.    As for Iron & Wine, Sam Beam is really venturing out of his safety zone this time around, and I'd say it's working for him for a good part of this record. Sam has always been a soft-spoken, intimate songwriter, so it's not surprising to feel as if he's being overshadowed by some of this instrumentation. The close connection Iron & Wine's old albums used to have seems missing here, and the production is no replacement--even if the quirky riffs and horns on ""Big Burned Hand,"" for example, are pretty fun.    There are quiet moments here that go over great, but a good chunk of this record doesn't feel all that personal or affecting.    What do you think of these albums? Love 'em? Hate 'em? Why?

Rather than continuing to embrace the folk, glam, baroque pop aesthetics that brought the band this far, Kaputt emulates the sounds of disco, new wave, and smooth jazz.  At first, it was almost a shock for me to hear this, but don't take this album for a simple novelty or indulgence. Destroyer's songwriting and personality are stronger than ever on this record. Plus, the production is some of the best this band has had the opportunity to show off.  Whether it's a straightforward pop ballads, or a vast, ambient introduction on tracks like ""Bay of Pigs,"" this album's attention to detail, style, and poetic sensuality should seduce most who come into contact with it. I'm getting hot just thinking about it.  What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it? Why?

Deerhoof- Deerhoof vs Evil ALBUM REVIEW,Y5Dy3MxEyTY,2011-01-24T17:41:20.000Z,21389,242,7,208,"Listen: http://www.deerhoofvsevil.com  Deerhoof's 10th album is built on the same freewheeling creativity that has made their past LPs such fun listens. The album changes without warning from sound to sound and song to song, which only plays into the quirky attitude.  The only major downside is this band's ADD cuts some potentially gripping moments short. The album definitely loses some memorability in it's brevity, because some of the best tracks aren't around long enough to leave a lasting impression.   The band's buzzing guitars, breezy vocals, and intricate drums are sounding better than ever. They chose the perfect time in their career to take on evil, I think.

The album does hold some issues in the vocal department, though. The band obviously tries to make up for it by drowning out a lot of the singing by playing louder and mixing the vocals lower.

These guys play a style of metal that buffet picks different sounds genre's roots. It sounds kinda retro without directly referencing one single band, and I think that's where the real success is. It's like they've been able to go back in time and hammer out a nice for themselves in what already seemed to be a crowded area.  The lyrics are very cultist and satanic, but still catchy. The slightly deadpan vocals only make the sound eerier--along with the sinister organ, of course.  Aside from some abrupt fades and endings, I don't have many complaints here.

Ghost track: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2394    On Cage the Elephant's new album, the band spends more time copying than they do creating.

The problem is Cage the Elephant almost sounds unmistakably like some of these bands and tunes when they're playing. Yes, they play really well together, and the recording here is great; however, there's a serious identity crisis pervading this album throughout.

Yesterday's review: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=2149    Röyksopp's fourth album comes quickly on the heels of their third, and serves as a stark contrast to it's predecessor. Rather than solidifying their sound further with the electropop beats and guest vocalists on Junior, Röyksopp has released an album of weary instrumentals powered by retro synths and drum machines.    It's a great sound, but not all that distinct--especially considering how much electronica of this variety I've been able to enjoy this year. Though it's not an offensively bad record, I was having a difficult time finding anything unique or overtly interesting about it. There are a few times this album reaches an outstanding pique, but it doesn't keep the magic together long enough to warrant any heavy praise. However, that's just my opinion.

It's a winning combination of raw experimentation and the desire to just make a fantastic dance track.    Unfortunately, not every song follows this formula. Skrillex reels in a lot of his eccentric edits on the second half of this EP, and the remixes tacked on the end are certainly decent.

Tonetta does touch down on politics, family, and other things on this album, but shock value is part of what makes this music so attractive.  The songs are pretty hit or miss for me, though, and it's hard not to feel as if something is missing when you're listening to the songs without the videos backing them up.

On this album, Tyler lashes out against hip hop, his negligent father, and rap blogs. He says most things for the lulz, but it's hard not to laugh along with him.    There's a lot of darkness on this album, too, where Tyler creates a killing, raping, and kidnapping persona who shows little to no sympathy for anything. It's hard not to compare it to DOOM or Eminem's early work.    There are some pretty decent beats flowing throughout this thing, too. It's a little too indulgent, but that's the nature of this album.

With arranger Joseph Trapanese, they've pulled together some really impressive combinations of electronics and acoustics. The 85-piece chamber orchestra makes this thing sound larger than life itself.    My main problem is that I can't really see myself enjoying this score outside of the movie itself, which has nothing to do with it being ""bad"" or ""mediocre."" My main problem is that the music seems so tailored to the movie--take into consideration the many short song lengths and abrupt song endings--that it feels like something is missing when I'm listening simply to this.    Whether or not this is a great soundtrack won't truly be known until Tron: Legacy is released, and Daft Punk fans are able to see the sound and sights tie together. That's the point of a score, isn't it? It's supposed to enhance your visual experience.    What do you think of this soundtrack? What about other soundtracks? Are you happy Daft Punk did this?

The riffs, drums, and lyrics all call back to that hardcore heyday when Black Flag was tearing it up.

Of course, this comes on the heels of a split the band released last year with he band Zombi, and it's all lead to Zombi member Steve Moore actually contributing quite a bit of synth work to this album.    The heavy production, keyboards, and extra melody makes this thing a huge improvement upon the sound the band forged on their 2007 album. If I were directing a fight scene in a huge action flick, this album would be my first pick for the soundtrack.    It's a great LP, but stops just short of amazing me. There are some points that could be drawn out a bit more, but I know a lotta people prefer their music to be more immediate than I do.

The weird personality and eccentricity seem to have melted away--or at least get a cover-up from all the new instrumentation on these tracks.    Many will say this release is a more mature direction, and that may be true; however, maturity isn't what brought me to the table in the first place. Album was an extremely fun release. It's quirks, experimental production, and strong pop hooks are what brought me into the fold; not pedal steel solos and forced drama.    There are some great songs on here, but there are too many moments and melodies recycled from the full-length debut to really go insane over the songwriting.    I realize many EPs are merely transitional periods for some bands, and I'm willing to accept that in this case. I'll be ready and waiting for the new Girls album when it drops, and I'm confident at least some of what made girls distinct to me will resurface.    What did you think of this EP? Love it? Hate it?

Marrow of the Spirit is nowhere near as distorted or heavy, but the band manages to overcome that with a lot more melody, dynamics, and acoustic instrumentation.  There are still some really brooding moments, and the long song lengths only enhance the dark mood the music shoots for. John Haughm really works to change up his vocal style on some pivotal points of the album, and the entire experience is really cohesive and cinematic.  This is another triumph for the band's discography, but it  really shouldn't be a surprise considering how consistent they've been thus far.  What did you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it? Why?

The production is extremely stunning. To be honest, this album sounds like a really huge undertaking with all of it's extra instrumentation, studio tricks, and samples.    Kanye has stepped up his rhyme game, too. It's also comforting to hear his guest MCs are rapping on his level.     My one problem is I think someone would need to have some kind of interest in Kanye West as a person, or persona, to truly fall in love with this album. I, unfortunately, don't really care about the minor details of the guy's social life. He's got a lot of talent, but his relationships and various character flaws don't really pique my interest for the entire album. There are points where I can't help but cheer him on when he tells his personal tale of success, but I could take or leave the moments of contrived social drama.

With an orchestra worth of instrumentation, Green chases after the classic soul sounds of Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. And most of the time, he catches them.

Technically, it's really the album of Shobaleader One, which is the name of the project Squarepusher is leading here. As usually, Jenkinson stirs up some surprising sounds and directions. He always keeps his fans guessing, and this is no exception. I like some of the songs here, but what's keeping me from loving the album is its tinny sound and its awkward mix. The robotic vocals are much louder than anything else on half of these songs, and the bass and guitars are way too processed. It's a great effort, and I expect better things in the future. I haven't given up on this idea. I just think the dust needs to settle a bit more on it.    What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it?

Check out the Good Ones: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1567  Diamond Rings' debut full-length is a pop album that knows its limits, but shows no signs of shame or fear. The project's founder, John O, brings passion into everything  he touches on this album. The vocal delivery is ballsy, the synths are bubbly and playful, the drum machines invite thoughts of a bedroom dance party. There's a load of ambition here, but the only sad part is Special Affections lacks the power and the flash to bring it to the next level.

MYTY KONKEROR MP3: http://theneedledrop.com/?p=1552  Warpaint's debut LP is an album of deeply hypnotic rock songs that slowly unfold with one phrase evolving into the next. It's an album that takes time to expose itself. It took me a couple of listens to really let the atmosphere of the LP surround me and hypnotize me.   Sadly, the Fool doesn't end with the strength it starts. The band seems to drift away from the formula that made earlier tracks so great with an acoustic number, some prominent electronics, and heavy-handed piano chords.   I still found the album to be enjoyable, though. It's just not making my eyes roll back into my head. There's clearly a lot of talent in this band, and I'm extremely happy to hear a new band with a female lineup that isn't falling into the same trend of Shangri-La worship.

Though it hops from style to style, the album maintains an extremely dark feel--even in the face of highly danceable beats.   It borders on monotony at some points, and Matthew Dear definitely doesn't make a name for himself here as a wordsmith; however, the production and atmosphere on this album are too good to completely deny.

While the album accomplishes what it sets out to do, that doesn't mean I'm enjoying it all that much.  If you're in the market for something that will make your eyes cross and ears run red with blood, head in this direction. But the album, for me, kind of straddles a weird spot between the accessible and experimental which just isn't agreeing with me. Sure, give me the accessible, or even put on a little noise music; but the combination of these two ideas on Face Tat just leaves me with an empty feeling. It's as if I've gained nothing from it.

The guitars shimmer over loads of warm bass and Caleb's signature vocal delivery. It's all very well arranged and produced, but I can't help but feel like the band has dulled down what made them the individuals that excited fans on their first few albums.    The album art is beyond appropriate for this album, though: An easygoing sunset. This setting is a nice place to visit. It's a calming image, for sure. But staring into a sunset for over forty minutes has never been a major interest of mine. I do know, however, there are plenty of people that would appeal to.    What do you think of this record?

It's a spectral album of songs that relies more on its sound than its songwriting. And that wouldn't be a bad thing if there was just a little more variety on this album.

The Age of Adz delivers on all the talk of electronics that built up to it, but the sounds Stevens bring to the table aren't that dynamic or interesting--which is surprising considering how vast Enjoy Your Rabbit was.    I like the songs, lyrics, melodies, and orchestrations a lot. The electronic beats and production is really what kills it for me.

The singles on it are extremely memorable, and blend hip hop and pop with ease; however, diving deeper into the tracks reveal a lot of filler, failed experiments, and sameness.    It attempts to genre cross, but only does so on a very minute scale. It's enjoyable at moments, certainly, but it just doesn't go far enough to keep me interested.

It's a style of music I'm a bit of a sucker for, but I think the songwriting is too good to deny.  The album's major flaw is a slightly muddy recording quality.

However, it's not appealing to me like I  hoped it would. Vigoda's mixture of slightly experimental instrumentation, new wave synths, and crooning vocals is definitely well-intentioned, but it leaves many songs feeling somewhat bland for me.     But please take this with a grain of salt, because this band never did too much for me in the first place. I was never in love with their stuff, but I found Skeleton and Reviver to be much more interesting than this. Hardcore fans will most likely be used to the ever-evolving sound Vigoda has been working with over the course of four albums.     I don't want to give the impression that this LP is completely boring or a dingy lack of effort. In fact, the production of Crush proves this release is an intensely labored effort. This time around, you can just chalk the score up to this not being my mug of joe.    What did you think of this album? Fav track? Least fav track? What did you think of the sound? The vocals?

It's something that I've been looking for--subconsciously, maybe--in a 2010 record.  How haunting and alone this album feels is what makes it stand out so much. But I don't want to give the impression that this LP is nothing but a mopey, self-loathing piece of trash. It's far from it.

It's pure, unadulterated testosterone. It's the kinda stuff that makes a perfect soundtrack to taking your shirt off and punching anything and everything withing arm's length.   Over the course of this LP's 10 tracks, the band alternates ideas from hardcore, thrash, and grind. The breakdowns fit snugly against the flurries of drums and grinding guitar, too.   I know I've given this a high score, but still want to say this album is not for everyone. It's only going to attract a very specific music fan: Someone who looks to put some real volume and intensity in their speakers. This thing isn't light-hearted or friendly by any means.

Instead, this album sounds more like a full, fleshed out version of what frontman Bradford Cox was shooting for on his last solo LP, Logos.

I believe Gira wants to legitimately bring the band back, and I wish him luck. I think with another LP, it's the rockier moments that will come off stronger than the acoustic ones.

There are certainly some really bright moments on this album like ""Walking Through That Door"" and ""Swept Inside,"" but there are pieces that fall to the wayside in terms of songwriting or production quality.  Even though this release is over thirty minutes, it still comes off feeling like a disjointed EP, not a fully fleshed LP based on a cohesive theme.

However, the jumbled, obnoxious, bizarre sounds on this album are turning me off without question.     False Priest takes it down a notch with the electronics, but that hasn't stopped the music from coming off eccentric. Barnes' vocal delivery is more pronounced than ever, layering one wacky falsetto over another.     There were a lot of highs and lows for me on this album, which will make for great conversation among fans. This band still has my admiration, but that doesn't mean I'm going to follow them everywhere they go.    What did you think of this album? Awesome? Not so awesome? What would you score it?

Interview: http://theneedledrop.tumblr.com/post/1076928302/keith-kenniff-is-a-boston-musician-with-several    Tera Melos' new album is both a complex and accessible step away from their Untitled LP. The hooks are more memorable, and the crystal clear recording quality is a fantastic compliment to the music; making every noodly riff very readable. It's relentless, but it has its moments of resolve. It's technical, but it has its moments of simplicity.     Despite all there is to like, I'm not heavily into this album. That because this music sits in an awkward spot for me. It's somewhat catchy and it's somewhat intense. If I'm looking for intensity, I'll shoot for something like Hella or Little Women. If I want something catchy, I'll go straight for Weezer; not some middle-ground. However, this is only my mindset.    So take my score and feelings toward this album with a grain of salt.

Lots of strings, piano, and horns bring a new dynamic to the band's sound. But the songwriting has suffered a bit as a result. Many of the tracks follow a linear model, building up instrumentation instead of changing it up between versus and choruses. Trying new things is grand, but I kinda just need Interpol to write me a bangin' rock song.    That does happen in a couple spots of the album, though. ""Barricade"" is undeniably catchy, and ""Summer Well"" is a good mix of Interpol's hook-writing magic and the added instrumentation.

Together, these two outfits hit just about everything with everything else, creating plinks, plops, bangs, and booms that build up into a minimalist wall of quirky sounds and simple melodies.     Though enticing sonically, this album is a little bland stylistically. It seems Matmos and So are content to just indulge in each others' favorite thing: sound. Though there are spots of acoustic guitar, keyboards, and horns that break things up, much of this stuff blends together a little bit into something that could use a little more variation.

If you're looking for something simply, easygoing, and cohesive, this is absolutely not the film for you. This movie is specifically targeted who like something a little disjointed and varied. It's a gift for anyone who likes to leave a film scratching their head.  Some of the effects impressed, and some didn't. Some of it was corny, and some of it wasn't. All that's clear is this really was weird. A little indulgent, too.  2 / 2 Thumbs  http://theneedledrop.com  http://bit.ly/TNDSupport  http://bit.ly/TNDTwitter  http://bit.ly/TNDFacebook",[],Animal Collective,Oddsac MOVIE,

The arrangements throughout this album complement the songs on an unbelievable level. It's almost as if the songs couldn't possibly survive without them.  The usual orchestra beauty Stevens specializes in is here, but some classic rock flavors are found on this release, too. Some very Pink Floyd-esque jams make a few moments here really special.

Many of the intros and instrumental passages are drawn out, but they add more to the songs than they take away. My biggest issue with the album is Bruce's voice. It's really the only part of the band that shows any age. He can't hit the highs like he used to. And though the strain is only apparent on a handful of tracks, the spots where it does show up are ruined. Examples include bits of ""Mother of Mercy"" and ""Starblind."" There are even points where Bruce runs himself breathless by writing more lyrics than he can chew.    All that aside, the songwriting is still catchy and detailed. The production could certainly be better, but there's still a love of exploration and adventure in this band's songwriting; plus, Maiden is easily the best-looking when it comes to their contemporaries. I'd rather listen to this 40 times before I listen to a new Ozzy album once, that's for sure.     The band is still kicking and still relevant.     What did you think of this record, though? Love it?

Tracks like Audience No. 2 bring are a real sensory overload, packing the mix with distortion and effects. But the album has a few severe potholes that leave me underwhelmed. Whether it's looping instrumentation or a lack of interesting sounds, some tracks just leave me cold and uninterested.

I'm not sure what to make of the darker sound that pervades this album, and I'm especially confused about all of the repetition.

This album is the sound of recovery, and the point of view of a human being with a long road of improvements ahead. Great beats, piano, and rhymes make this thing too powerful to deny; plus, the guest spots from Monsters of Folk, Joanna Newsom, and John Legend put some real separation between the tracks. It really is a great album, and a high point for hip hop in 2010.  What do you think of this album? Love it? Hate it?

The differences that separated the band's two main songwriters, Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug, are slowly disappearing. The loud, voluminous production on this release makes for a highly visceral experience, but Dan fits into this mold much easier than Spencer does. It's the most no nonsense this band has ever been, but they've dampened their idiosyncrasies a bit in the process.    This is still an admirable record, though, and one hardcore fans are probably going to enjoy more than me.

The record company came at a time when experimental rock--dubbed ""krautrock"" at the time--was getting into full swing, and experimenting with jazz, folk, and synths. There are a lot of left curves on this release; including film music, some spots of minimalism, and a little noise, too.

There's a lot less distortion, noise, and lengthy explorative tracks on this new LP. The band chooses to keep things short and sweet, sticking to tracks that mostly range from three to four minutes. But a lot happens within these time constraints: sharp guitar solos, bubbling synth arpeggios, and warm electronic chords gently pulsate in an ambient fashion. Very pretty colors and extremely promising instrumentation. But to go back to the song lengths: the shorter amounts of time really do choke off how much the band and the listener are able to explore a given musical idea. This isn't pop, and there's no reason for some of these tracks to be this abrupt. Venture into the unknown a little.   What did you think of this LP? Love it? Hate it?

All animae references aside, this thing is great for dozens of reasons: immediate, conceptual, varied, and engaging. There's not a moment where I felt underwhelmed. The most out-of-place track has to be the Of Montreal collaboration on ""Make the Bus,"" which isn't doing too much for me. Outside of that, I can't really say anything bad about this album.

A really chill mood pervades this entire release, but much of the time I find myself wanting more. I wish this thing took a few more chances; however, I still have to give huge props to the musicianship and the crisp, clean production.     Is it an awful album that you should steer clear of? No. It's simply not my cup of tea is all.

Pink's obsession with new wave, glam rock, disco, and post-punk continues as usual, but the strange, surreal recording tricks crowding his earlier work aren't as prevalent.  Though the songs are still great--really great, in fact--longtime fans may be a little disheartened by the overall lack of ""weirdness.""

A lot of strong influences coming from the 70s and 80s on this one--especially from the realms of post-punk, disco, and new wave. I already have an affinity for this music, so it was fantastic to hear a modern band just do it right. LCD has really built upon a classic sound this time around; bringing a style back with sincerity, and putting their own spin on it, too. Great songs, melodies, lyrics, and grooves. Hardly a scratch on this thing. I felt a little underwhelmed by one track, and I'm happy that's my biggest complaint. I can hardly nit pick on this thing.  What do you think about this album?

Jack White brings some great guitar sounds so the mix, and overall the production is just top-notch. My one issue is with the vocals and vocal deliveries. It sounds almost as if White and Moss are trying too hard to have soul, I'm not sure. I've heard White sound a lot more natural on his previous efforts, and wish that same feel came across on this album, too. I figure my issue with the vocals will probably be some tick that I'm only feeling, heh. Maybe I'm crazy.    What do you think of this album? Do you love it? Hate it?

If disorienting musical aggression isn't your thing, I understand. But if it is, then your ears need to be on this band's debut full-length. This group features elements of math rock, free jazz, metal, and punk sped up until they've disintegrated into a fine powder that gets you pretty messed up when snorted.

The guitar sounds are fantastic, and the drums are the perfect compliment to how brash the music is. However, I have to say this is one of those instances where one isolated part of this music is ruining the whole thing for me: the vocals. Whether it's the recording or the mixing, they sound so tinny and out of place. It's almost as if the vocal tracks were meant for a different album.  The music is still undeniably catchy and brutal, but I just wish the vox lived up to that same standard.   Circle the Wagons is a shot of hardcore adrenaline.

If you've enjoyed Snaith's past releases, this is worth your time. I'd also recommend it to Four Tet fans, Pantha Du Prince fans, and Arthur Russell fans.

It makes guys like G.G. Allin look like a kitten, and that's no lie. Despite it's great songs, attitude, and approach, the LP as always suffered from mixing issues. It was originally mixed in '73 by Iggy Pop, but then by David Bowie after Legacy was unhappy with the original version. In '97, the album was remixed again, and Iggy was in charge this time around. The result was one of the most compressed, punishing musical experiences I've ever had. A lot of people got down on the distortion and the imperfections of that '97 version, but that sound was clearly the '73 intent when you compare it to the very first mixes, which were issued in '95 via a compilation titled Rough Power. Though I'm not a fan of the Bowie mix, because it's way too tinny and devoid of drums, it's still a piece of rock history. It's good that it not go completely into obscurity, but I still can't say it's the go-to place to hear the Stooges' real, raw power. I'm still a big fan of the Iggy version, and would like the guide all the new potential Stooges listeners to that particular release. Fans of the Bowie mix will find this remastered version pleasurable, and the live performances on this LP aren't bad, too. This edition is just more of a collector's item than an absolute interpretation, for me.     If you haven't done it yet, listen to the Stooges.

His last album was released in 1999, and was recorded while in jail. Of course, Varg's two jailtime LPs went in a much more ambient direction, Belus is a comparative shock. This album is loud, harsh, and distorted as the flaming, demon-filled pits of hell. Though we expect black metal to have a lo-fi sound, the massive amount of guitar on this album has to be due to some lackluster production. Burzum's previous LPs are much less repetitive and have a better sonic balance--even though they're comprised of lo-fi recordings, too. Though it's cool to see that Varg is getting back into the saddle, I can't say this is all that exciting or interesting as a standalone piece of music. Varg's infamous reputation is fueling a lot of hype around this album, but the music simply fails to live up to it.  4/10  http://www.theneedledrop.com",['4/10'],Burzum,Belus,
Black Tambourine Anthology Review,U-xB_onteuA,2010-04-05T22:49:07.000Z,8809,113,11,39,"Listen: http://bit.ly/dgD7gN / http://bit.ly/C9HQh    This new compilation CD from Black Tambourine covers all of this short-lived band's recordings. For two years, this DC outfit blended their love of Phil Spector and the UK's shoegaze movement into a unique brand of noise pop. It's weird to hear such sweet, haunting songs nailed onto a harsh wall of distortion, but that's what made Black Tambourine Black Tambourine. Though these guys never hit it big--and probably never will--they're undoubtedly a big deal to bands like Vivian Girls, Dum Dum Girls, and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart. If those bands are topping your Last.fm charts or getting a lot of replays on your MP3 player, then Black Tambourine should be your next musical destination, for sure. Even if they don't win you over completely, their obscure place in American independent rock history is something to appreciate.    7/10    http://www.theneedledrop.com",['7/10'],list index out of range,list index out of range,list index out of range
Jonsi- Go Review,PlNynmu_Cp0,2010-04-05T06:34:23.000Z,18002,171,7,73,"Listen: http://bit.ly/dq4y2H / http://bit.ly/6xPThE    Parlophone album sampler: http://bit.ly/cNMYUe    On Jonsi's solo debut, the Icelandic singer and guitarist explores numerous sides of his musical psyche. There are tight, full, lush tracks with a really immediate feel. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are some really atmospheric tracks that take their time building. Though each moment is just as creative as the next, Go does suffer from some stylistic inconsistency. Whether or not you like this LP is really gonna be based on how well you can keep up with Jonsi as he jumps from one sound to the other. I find myself favoring the slower tracks, but I'm positive there will be people who feel otherwise. If you can keep up with all the shifts this album makes, all the more power to you.

The duo is as abstract as they've ever been, heading in a softer, more ambient approach for this release. The gentler direction resembles that of their 1994 album Amber, but with a wider sonic vocabulary. Oversteps doesn't offer much in terms of clear song structures, too. It's an album that would much rather explore than plan out a route.     To be honest, I found their last album to be a lot more thrilling, but what works for me might not work for you. If you're looking for something that quietly cuts its way through the digital jungle. Oversteps should be your destination.    5/10",['5/10'],Autechre,,Oversteps

With Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor getting co-production credits, it should be no surprise Big Echo is sounding a lot like his band's previous efforts.    For me, this new approach is having some really mixed results. Some of the added instrumentation and interludes distract from the songs more than they add. The constant interludes take each track through detour after detour without showing anything all that scenic, to be honest.     There are some real bangers on Big Echo, though. They just happen to be the most straightforward songs. There's no reason to lose faith in this band, but this album is clearly the sound of them executing their new-found ideas for the first time.    6/10    http://theneedledrop.com    http://twitter.com/theneedledrop",['6/10'],The Morning Benders,Big Echo,

MGMT's Congratulations makes me want to say this to the band: Congratulations. It's a neo-psych rock drama, bursting with cinematic tracks. A real solid beginning-to-end listen. Some songs pale in comparison to others, but Congratulations still avoids falling prey to high highs and low lows. This music is a modern day take on the rock guys like Bowie, The Beatles, and Arthur Brown were playing with back in the day, and it even takes the time to pick up some new wave and post-punk influences, too. MGMT is clearly well-versed in the language of rock, and this album is a result of the fluency.  8/10 http://www.theneedledrop.com/loved-list/2010  http://www.theneedledrop.com  Support TND: http://bit.ly/b5smgj  Twitter: http://bit.ly/bmH8y1",['8/10'],MGMT,Congratulations,

The Man takes a more straightforward approach than anything the band has does in the past. Though it's all done in the name of being immediate and memorable, I can't really say this album is all that catchy or engaging. It's almost too simple to warrant attention. 2008's Censored Colors saw P.TM playing with some masterfully produced glam/folk/progressive rock sounds, and even 2009's The Satanic Satanist beats American Ghetto in the subtlety department.     The choppy production and hip hop beats on AG just don't lend  all that much originality to the recording. They weight the songs down instead of propping them up, and dumb down the great melodies and songwriting the band has going. Though I would hate to see the band produced another Censored Colors, giving the music a little more time to breathe and build couldn't hurt.    3/10    http://www.theneedledrop.com",['3/10'],Portugal.

Without jumping into the realm of overproduction, this album has some really quality sounds. It's not as alienating as some lo-fi BM recordings may be, and something a range of metal fans could appreciate. There's quite a bit of variation among these tracks, too; it's just enough to make the 50 minutes they span a worthwhile listen.

Instead of producing a mesh of Burton's studio creativity and Mercer's passionate songwriting, both of these guys use this album to take a backseat. Nothing on this LP burns brightly, takes charge, or attempts to thrill. All in all, it's a pleasant listen, which isn't inherently bad, but Broken Bells only makes for a breezy listen that isn't very engaging. Though the production is clean, and the melodies are agreeable, but I'd be lying to myself if I said this thing stands out.    Have you heard the album? If so, what did you think of it? Love it?

Let's just hope we're not in for another Tomorrow, In A Year. The production on this track makes it extremely surreal, coming off like a lost disco jam full of eccentric vocals.

They create an alternate dimension where eerie sounds and dissonant intervals reign supreme. There are some lush strings, a spot of horns; but Sisterworld revolves mostly around the simplicity of normal rock instrumentation. Yet, it sounds so otherworldly.   Overall, it lays on the tension a little too much, kind of making it difficult to enjoy. But it would be stupid to assume that wasn't the underlying intent. Though I wasn't able to enjoy that anxiety as much as some people may, I've still got to give kudos to these guys for turning another cohesive concept into an album.  6/10  http://theneedledrop.com  Support TND: http://bit.ly/2ss0ND  Our podcast: http://bit.ly/a5jiED  http://twitter.com/theneedledrop",['6/10'],Liars,Sisterworld,

This thing is unreasonably difficult, and never really illustrates as to why. And the few musical moments at the end of the album might sound like sweet relief, but they're only decent in comparison to the 40 plus minutes of unrewarding crap you have to sift through in order to get to them. This album is a childish attempt at avant composition that only exposes the Knife and their collaborators as specs on a map compared to the big names like Zorn, Stockhausen, and Cage. It's just commissioned art project pap, passing itself off as some kind of deep, conceptual piece of music reflecting the work and life of Charles Darwin. The story could be different if I was actually watching the stage show of this performance piece, but as a standalone album, Tomorrow, In a Year just doesn't work.
